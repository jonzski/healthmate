## Project Name 
 - HealthMate

## Project Description
 - This project called HealthMate is a mobile application designed to facilitate health monitoring and management for students and employees of the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os (UPLB). The application aims to ensure the well-being and safety of the UPLB community by providing a convenient and efficient platform for health tracking, symptom reporting, and contact tracing.

- The system consists of three main user views: User's View, Admin's View, and Entrance Monitor's View. Each view caters to specific roles and responsibilities within the UPLB community.

### User's View:

- In the User's View, individuals can sign in or sign up to create an account. They can securely authenticate and access features such as:

- Sign In/Sign Up: Users can authenticate themselves using their credentials or create a new account to access the system.

- Personal Information: Users can provide their name, username, college, course, and student number during the sign-up process.

- Pre-existing Illness: Users must declare any pre-existing illnesses they may have, such as hypertension, diabetes, tuberculosis, cancer, kidney disease, cardiac disease, autoimmune disease, asthma, or allergies.

- Homepage: Users can view a list of their health entries and check whether they are quarantined or not.

- My Profile: Users can access their personal profile, including a QR code for their building pass. The QR code is generated daily and cannot be generated if the user is quarantined, experiencing symptoms, or has no health entry.

- Add Today's Entry: Users can input their health status for the day, including any symptoms they may be experiencing. If the user has symptoms from a predefined list (such as fever, cough, sore throat, etc.), they will not be allowed entry, and the QR code will not be generated.

- Edit/Delete Today's Entry: Users can edit or delete their health entry, but the changes must be approved by the admin.

### Admin's View:
- The Admin's View is accessible to authorized administrators and provides additional functionalities, including:

- Sign In/Sign Up: Admins can authenticate themselves using their credentials or create a new account with appropriate permissions.

- View and Manage Students: Admins can view all students' health records and apply filters based on date, course, college, or student number. They can also add students to quarantine, remove students from quarantine, and move students to monitoring.

- Approve/Reject Requests: Admins can approve or reject delete/edit requests made by students for their health entries.

- Elevate User Type: Admins can elevate user types from default users to admin/monitor status.

### Entrance Monitor's View:
- The Entrance Monitor's View is specifically designed for entrance monitors and includes the following features:

- Sign In/Sign Up: Entrance monitors can authenticate themselves using their credentials or create a new account with appropriate permissions.

- Search Student Logs: Entrance monitors can search for specific student logs and view the details of students who entered.

- Read Generated QR: Entrance monitors can scan and read the generated QR codes to verify entry permissions.

- Update Logs: Entrance monitors can update student logs by recording their location, student number, and status (cleared, under monitoring, under quarantine).

Overall, the HealthMate aims to streamline health monitoring processes, ensure compliance with health protocols, and provide an effective tool for contact tracing within the UPLB community. By implementing this system, UPLB can enhance the safety and well-being of its students and employees, enabling a healthier environment for learning and work.
